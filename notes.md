Continuous Delivery vs. Continuous Deployment  
> Continuous deployment is the practice of releasing every good build to users – a more accurate name might have been "continuous release".

> Continuous delivery (...) any build could potentially be released to users at the touch of a button using a fully automated process in a matter of seconds or minutes.

Fail Fast pattern  
> In a software release process Fail Fast means releasing undeployed code as fast as possible, instead of waiting for a weekly release to break.

Cycle Time  
> The time from deciding that ou need to make a change to having it in production is knwon as the _cycle time_, and it is a vital metric for any project.
